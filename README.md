# ASL_Fingerspelling
An application that allows the user to signal out letters using American Sign Language and then using video images and palm detection algorithms predict Ô¨Årst the letter and then combine to predict the whole word. Once the key-points are fetched from the palms they are produced to a pre-trained convolutional neural network that predicts the word.
